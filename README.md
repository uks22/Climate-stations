Problem Statement:
A city is divided into ‘n’ no. of different climate stations. Each station has some urban parameters and weather 
parameters. Urban parameters include
1. Sky view factor (range from 0.1 to 0.9) 
2. Vegetation density ratio (%age value)
3. Population density (Number of people per Sq. km)
4. Pervious surface fraction (range from 0 to 15)
5. Impervious surface fraction (range from 0 to 15)
6. Station status (urban/rural) 
7. Distance of station to other stations (in km) 
Weather parameters are air temperature, relative humidity recorded for each station every day for one month.


For solving above mentioned problem structure (in C) was used to satisfy the functionality as required by the problem statement.
